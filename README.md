### Context:

This is my final solo project for Module 1. I have completed 2 other solo projects and this one is a culmunation of all we have learned in Module 1. Using Javascript, class to class interaction, updating the data model and the DOM. We used CSS and HTML as well.

### Learning Goals:

The learning goals of this project was to solidify our understanding of DRY Javascript. Understand the difference between the DOM and date model. Using for loops and event delegation in our code.
Also, to show problem solving by looking at a large task and break it down piece by piece.


### Wins + Challenges:

*Challenges:* I struggled with figuring out where to start. It took some time for me to see this large task in multiple small features. Once I was able to start and focus on the data model, my next challenge was figuring out how to print it and find it working or not working.
I also found the order of operations a bit challenging. Figuring out what order they needed to be in, in order to function properly.

*Wins:* I am really proud of how I navigated the CSS and HTML. Although it is still nothing spectacular, I was able to navigate it a bit more and understand where and when I needed to change things and add classes to specific places in the HTML. 
I also am taking a big win getting this to actually work. There was a lot going on and instead of getting flustered and wanting to quit, I would take breaks, come back with fresh eyes and try to look at whatever I was working on from a different perspective.
